WarehouseDimLinkHelp1=When the Warehouse dimension link is active, the value of the selected dimension on all transactions will be determined based on the value of the Warehouse storage dimension. However, transactions may still be posted regardless of the dimension value.

WarehouseDimLinkHelp2=When the Warehouse dimension link is locked, transactions can only be posted if the value of the selected dimension matches the value associated with the Warehouse storage dimension. Hence, all open transactions must be updated before the dimension link can be locked.
